# LinearRegression
Hi All,  In the problem we are going to forecast the profit of an organization by looking into the R&amp;D spend , Administration, Marketing Spend and the state in which the organization operates. As you can see here we are predicting a continuous value that means it becomes a regression problem.  At the end of or process we will find out how much profit an organization likely to make depend upon its spending on these areas.  Please try to do by own in jupyter notebook. If you have any issues please feel free to contact me. I will be happy to answer it.
